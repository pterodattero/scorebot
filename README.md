# Scorebot

A Telegram bot meant to keep track of the scores of games and challenges.

## Setup

Download the entire folder on the machine you want to use to run the program. Open a Python 3 console and run main.py.
If you don't do so you want be able to stop the bot in a civil way, because you'll have to restart the kernel for interrupting the background processes.
If you run it inside a console (you can use `runfile('main.py')`) the bot can be gently stopped using `updater.idle()` and `Cltr+C`.

Required libraries are:
* python-telegram-api
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn (just for style)

Enjoy!
